## Description

This is my portfolio to showcase my skills and talents to future employers. This will act as my online resume to show my current (nd future) projects. 

I learned a great deal with this project. I was able to build on what I had learned building my [prework sudy-guide](https://itsa-me-dea.github.io/prework-study-guide/). With this project, I was able to apply more advanced CSS features, such as flexbox and media queries. I also gained a better foothold on elements and classes, and on how to nest my items.
